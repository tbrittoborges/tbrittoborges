Senior Bioinformatics Researcher | PhD in Bioinformatics and ML | specializing in RNA splicing, post-transcriptional regulation & computational workflow development. 

### Overview:

I use programming to create systems that enable our team to make data-driven decisions. Specialized in analyzing clinical and OMICs datasets (often dirty in nature) to uncover insights in disease diagnosis, treatment, and treatment mode of action. My expertise spans from developing computational workflows to integrating machine learning techniques on scientific research. I like to use benchmark  benchmarking and then leveraging state-of-the-art methodologies to contribute to multidisciplinary teams in computational biology.

### Skills & Interests:

- Proficient in Python and R, keen to learn new languages if required.
- Tools: Snakemake/Nextflow.
- Experience interfacing between multidisciplinary teams.
- Fields of Interest: Bioinformatics/Computational Biology, Interpretable Machine Learning, RNA Splicing, Transcriptomics, Proteomics.
